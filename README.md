# pands-problems

Introduction:
This repository includes practical excersises from the module programming and scripting in python as well as problems and resolution of assessment (problem sheet).
The problems sheet includes weekly tasks to be resolved depending on the topic that been introduced for the specific week.
-------------------------------------
The break-down of the weekly tasks is as follows:
-------------------------------------

1- Task02, BMI calculator:
In this task a calculator of the body mass index BMI was syntaxed. The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared. 

--------------------------------------

2- Task03, state and variables:
A program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order. 

-------------------------------------

3- Task04, controlling the flow:
A  a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.

-------------------------------------

4- Task05, Data structures:
A program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. If the the current day is weekday, the program output will be:
Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.
otherwise, if it is a weekend, then the output would be:
It is the weekend, yay!

--------------------------------------

5- Task06, Functions:
A program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. There are two solutions privided, first one is by importing the squareroot, math library and writing the program based on it. The other solution has been researched and a solution based on internet research has been provided.

--------------------------------------

6- Task07, Files:
A program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. The program takes the filename from an argument on the command line.

--------------------------------------

7- Task08, Plot:
A  program that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
